# Practice projects
### Even or odd
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

**Concepts to keep in mind:**
* If/Else statements
* Input/Output
* Modular arithmetic (the modulus operator)
* Print

### Dice rolling simulator
This project involves writing a program that simulates rolling a die. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6 and print, then ask the user if they will like to roll again.

**Concepts to keep in mind:**
* Random
* Integer
* Print
* While loops

### Guess the number
The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

**Concepts to keep in mind:**
* Random function
* Integers
* Input/Output
* Print
* While loops
* If/Else statements
